## Navigate to Segment Details

1. Click on the row that contains the segment.
2. You will now be able to see the Segment Details View. If one or more of the project's segmenters have been removed since an experiment has been created, the segmenter highlighted in red is no longer in use for the experiment.

At the top row, you will be able to see your segment name.

### Configuration

1. Activity: Activity details of segment.
2. Segment: Different segmenter settings of the Segment.

### History

When a segment is modified (edited / activated / deactivated) its existing configurations are saved as a historical version. All versions can be viewed from the **History** tab of the Segment Detail view.

The versions are ordered in the descending order of creation (the most recent version appearing on top). The Created and Updated dates of the version symbolize the duration that the configuration was applied in the segment. Selecting a row opens the details of the version.
