### History

When a treatment is modified (edited / activated / deactivated) its existing configurations are saved as a historical version. All versions can be viewed from the **History** tab of the Treatment Details view.

The versions are ordered in the descending order of creation (the most recent version appearing on top). The Created and Updated dates of the version symbolize the duration that the configuration was applied in the treatment. Selecting a row opens the details of the version.
