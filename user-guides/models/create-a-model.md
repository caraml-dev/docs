# Create a Model

Model represent machine learning model. A model can have a type which determine how the model can be deployed. CaraML supports both standard model (XGBoost, SKLearn, Tensorflow, and PyTorch) and user-defined model (PyFunc, Custom Golang and Java model).&#x20;

Conceptually, Model in CaraML is similar to a class in programming language. To instantiate a Model youâ€™ll have to create a Model Version.

`merlin.set_model(<model_name>, <model_type>)` will set the active model to the name given by parameter. If the Model with given name is not found, a new Model will be created.

```python
import merlin
from merlin.model import ModelType

merlin.set_model("tensorflow-model", ModelType.TENSORFLOW)
```
