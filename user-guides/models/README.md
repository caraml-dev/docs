# Models

Model represent machine learning model. A model can have a type which determine how the model can be deployed. CaraML supports both standard model (XGBoost, SKLearn, Tensorflow, and PyTorch) and user-defined model (PyFunc, Custom Golang and Java model). Conceptually, model in CaraML is similar to a class in programming language. To instantiate a model youâ€™ll have to create a model version.
