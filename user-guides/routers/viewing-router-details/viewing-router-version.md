# Configuration

The configuration tab displays the configuration of the deployed version of the router. These values are either configured when creating a router or editing a router.

If there are traffic rules (See: [Configure Traffic Rules](broken-reference)) configured on the router, then you will see a ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/traffic\_split\_icon.png) button next to the routes that are part of a traffic-split configuration. Click on the button to expand the row and see traffic rules and their conditions:
