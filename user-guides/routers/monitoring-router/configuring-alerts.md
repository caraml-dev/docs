# Configure Alerts

{% hint style="warning" %}
This document assumes that an appropriate alerting solution has been integrated to the deployment of CaraML. The actual functionality may be different, according to the specific deployment configurations.
{% endhint %}

You can configure alerts for the critical metrics of your deployed router. An alert will be fired if a metric is out of range, to the destination set up in the alerting backend.

1\. Navigate to the Router Details View of your router.

2\. Click on the Alerts Tab and then, the Configure Alerts button.&#x20;

3\. Select a team that must be informed of any alerts associated with your router. You can choose a provided team from the dropdown or enter a custom team. You will only be able to configure a **single team** for all your alerts.&#x20;
